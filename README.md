# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Networks

Description:

Welcome to the Microsoft Stock Price Prediction project repository! In this project, delve into the realm of deep learning with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation. Accurate prediction of stock prices is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts to make informed decisions and devise effective strategies in the dynamic stock market environment.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Historical stock price data of Microsoft Corporation is gathered from reliable financial sources, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for training the predictive model.

Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing pipeline involves handling missing values, scaling the features, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to prepare the data for training and evaluation.

LSTM Model Architecture: Construct LSTM neural networks, a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN), capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

Model Training: The LSTM model is trained using historical stock price data, optimizing model parameters to minimize prediction errors and improve forecast accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of stock price predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To enhance the performance of the LSTM model, conduct hyperparameter tuning, adjusting parameters such as the number of LSTM units, learning rate, and dropout rate to optimize model performance.

Forecasting: The trained LSTM model enables generation of future stock price predictions, providing valuable insights for investors and traders to anticipate market trends and make informed decisions.

Documentation: Detailed documentation accompanies the project, including explanations of LSTM architecture, code comments, and usage guidelines, facilitating easy understanding and replication of the predictive model.
